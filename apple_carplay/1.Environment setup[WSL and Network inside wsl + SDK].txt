Step 1-install wsl and ubuntu distro
	-in powershell window(admin)
		"wsl --install"
		This command will enable the required optional components, download the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as your default, and install a Linux distribution for you (Ubuntu by default).
	
	-use command
		"wsl -l -v"
		this will list the installed distros. and should contain ubuntu atleast.



Step 2- running ubuntu inside WSl2
		-open cmd or windows terminal.
		-use command 
			"wsl"
			this will boot the default distro which is ubuntu in our case.
		in further tutorial we will mention this window as ubuntu terminal.


step 3- Obtain root privilages in ubuntu terminal.
		"sudo s"
		"cd /etc"

powershell displays all dns servers
		"Get-DnsClientServerAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ServerAddresses"
		
		copy these Ip addresses somethere in a text editor add keyword "nameserver" before each ip address. list should look like.
		
		example-
		nameserver 187.8.90.29
		nameserver 123.1.14.121
		and so on


step 4-	wsl.conf
		"	[network]
			generateResolvConf = false
			user@host:/etc$	"
		wsl resets resolv.conf file at each boot up the above lines disable that feature of wsl.	
		
step 5- resolv.conf
		"chattr -i resolv.conf" to make it editable
		now paste the nameserver list and save the file






services.msc
Lxssmanager

ping google.com
ping gerrit1.harman.com

above commands should return some values stating packet recieved. otherwise wont be able to connect to internet.

-------------------------------------WSL setup is now complete  we need to setup SDK Now----------------------------------------------


1.For installing SDK download the latest zip on windows OS.
2.In Ubuntu terminal "cd /home/[username]"    replace username with wichever folder is present inside home directory.
3.use command "explorer.exe ."  it will open windows explorer window with your current ubuntu path.
4.paste extracted sdk files here. 
5.on ubuntu terminal cd into the sdk folder that you have pasted and run "chmod 777 ***"
6.run "./elina-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-cortexa9hf-neon-toolchain-2.3.4-orinoco.sh" this will execute the shell file once completed.
7.run "./update_sdk.sh elina-orinoco-glibc-x86_64-arm-harfwsdk-toyotacy20-t077-mx6q.tar.bz2"







before compiling new build remember to source environment each time you use a new terminal.
environment sourcing 
. /opt/elina/2.3.4/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-neon-elina-linux-gnueabi
