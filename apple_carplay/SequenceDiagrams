RemoteUI::RemoteUIControlServiceProcessor

form this perticular service all functionalitys where HMI is trying to get service from remore UI or inform what exactly with the user action , 
every thing is inform through this perticular service.

some basic use cases and how they are exactly be implimented from this perticular service.

There different parties HMI(Human Machine Interface - Touch screen ) , RMUI(Remote UI) , MD(Mobile Device - Phone)

**** Thease are simple basic sequences or use cases of where user request to enter the interactive mode or comming out of interactive mode. ****

Intractive Mode:

When we click on MHI icon in CarPlay which is beeing top corrner left side. 
when we are start Projection screen StartProjection() - HMI will send enterinteractiveMode(TargetApplication=UNKNOWN(any of the screen))

HMI will send enterinteractiveMode(TargetApplication=UNKNOWN(any of the screen)) and RMUI will recive and send ShowProjection() - call requestUI() 
to MD-Mobile device (Phone)
from the Mobile Device a screen set-up  will start a projection screen ProjectionModeScreen() to RemoteUI 
from the RemoteUI send the screen projection request to HMI using intractiveModeStatusChange(true) 

Go out of intractive mode:

if we want to Go out of intractive mode by pressing home button or else HMI will send leaveInteractiveMode() 
and its a generic call showNativeScreen() main Screen: (Take/User-init/user-init/Anytime) Then phone will give screen cleared on request and 
respond nativeModeScreen() , 
It will cofirmation from the phone to stop the streaming of the video screen.
Then send interactiveModeStatusChanged(false,returnSceenInfo)

**** Thease are simple basic sequences or use cases of where user request to enter the interactive mode or comming out of interactive mode. ****

**** In the same way the phone can also send a request to show it a screen or to close it a screen.  ****

phone will send request to projectionModeScreen() and  to show  the screen then call interactiveModeStatusChanged(True) 
phone will send request to nativeModeScreen() and  screen cleared on request then call interactiveModeStatusChanged(false,DEFINED) and 
interactiveModeStatusChanged(false,UNKNOWN) - [ Mobile Device leaves temporay Interactive Mode ] 

**** In the same way the phone can also send a request to show it a screen or to close it a screen.  ****
