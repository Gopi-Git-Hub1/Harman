Other place to Service
	
Service -> OutSide(Subscribed ServiceClients): Notifications to others


device->technology
- CControl:
	- Centralized place to process all the data coming from different places - Service / Hardkey / TouchPad / Touch Screen / CP Platform	
	- Sending data to this file either by Mocca Events / direct calls

- DeviceControl:
	- CContol->DeviceControl->Platform->Phone

- CConfigModifier: It uses to handle technology specifies configuration file available in source/imp/data/configuration/CarPlay folder


carplay_service folder (CarPlay_Service/src/core/src): Platform related specific communicaition both Events & Methods

ServiceClients
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Events:
ServiceClient->RMUIServer
RMUIService->CControl and where ever it is required

Mocca Events
----------------------------------------------------
Event
EventData 
EventConsumer

Subscribe
rmui::bluetooth::CConnectedProfilesChangedEvent::addListener(*this);

Unsubscribe
rmui::bluetooth::CConnectedProfilesChangedEvent::removeListener(*this);

Consumer
processEvent(const rmui::bluetooth::CConnectedProfilesChangedEvent &event)

Create EventData class
Bind EventData, Event, Consumer

Implement EventConsumer where ever this event has to be received
public CMultiThreadEventSender,

Event Generation:
CClientSystemActivationReadyEvent& event = *CClientSystemActivationReadyEvent::createEvent(CClientSystemActivationReadyEventData(mConnected));
event.send();
